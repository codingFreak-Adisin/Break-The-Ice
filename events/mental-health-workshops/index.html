					<p>Break.The.Ice conducted various mental health workshops for children in underprivileged 
						sections to empower them and help them learn more about mental health and how they can 
						take care of themselves! We talked about mental health journals, helplines and seeking 
						for help when you need! Around 50 children from classes 6th to 11th were enlightened and
						 were made to realise that stigmas must not exist around mental health. With discussions
						  and worksheets around mental health during the session, the children left the session 
						  as young mental health enthusiasts. </p>
